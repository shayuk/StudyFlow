# Proposed deletions (do not delete automatically)

- server/prisma/.env
  Reason: Prisma loads variables from both .env and prisma/.env. Having the same key (DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL) in both files causes a CI failure: "There is a conflict between env var in .env and prisma/.env". Consolidate application env vars (e.g., DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL) into server/.env only. Keep prisma/.env exclusively for DB-specific variables (DATABASE_URL) or remove it entirely.

Remediation steps:
1) Ensure server/.env contains: DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=<value>.
2) Remove DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL from server/prisma/.env (or delete the file).
3) Re-run CI (Prisma generate step should pass).

- vercel.json (repo root)
  Reason: Vercel project Root Directory will be set to server/, so only server/vercel.json is used. Keeping a second vercel.json at repo root is confusing and unused.
  Timing: After confirming Vercel Root Directory is server/ and a successful Production deploy, remove the root vercel.json.
